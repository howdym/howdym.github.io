                        <p></p>

                        Using OpenCV and Mediapipe Hands to detect hand motion, hand gestures, 
                        and block locations, we are able to detect when and where a user is 
                        grabbing and releasing a block. 

                        <p></p>

                        We intend to use this block movement detection as an extension to 
                        <a href="https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/projects/">Multicraft</a>, 
                        which is a project that provides multi-modal methods of playing Minecraft 
                        such as using gaze or speech as ways of input to play Minecraft. This 
                        block movement detection will be another mode of playing Minecraft, by 
                        using tangible blocks to build structures in real life that can be 
                        replicated in Minecraft via this code.

                        <p></p> 

                        This provides additional affordances to those who may have trouble playing 
                        Minecraft in the traditional modes, such as those in the BVI community and 
                        younger individuals. 

                        <p></p> 

                        Next steps involve beginning to center our work with the communities we are 
                        trying to work with through this project, redefine our positionality as 
                        researchers, integrating this code into Multicraft, and refining the heuristics 
                        and algorithm used in this code.

                        <p></p>

                        This was a group project made by my team for a class. The objective of this 
                        project was to create a way for users to get their questions answered without 
                        having to leave Slack, a communication application commonly used by students 
                        and professionals.

                        <p></p>

                        To approach this, we created a bot that can detect when someone is asking a question. 
                        If the question is about the definition of word, the bot takes the context of the 
                        conversation and returns a Wikipedia article with the definition. If the question is 
                        about where a location is, when an event occurred, or a description of what something is,
                        the bot returns a response from the Encyclopedia Brittanica. 
                        
                        <p></p>

                        My contribution to this project was mainly creating the context extraction, question 
                        detection algorithm, and ":query" command.
