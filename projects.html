                                        Using OpenCV and Mediapipe Hands to detect hand motion, hand gestures, 
                                        and block locations, we are able to detect when and where a user is 
                                        grabbing and releasing a block.

                                        which is a project that provides multi-modal methods of playing Minecraft 
                                        such as using gaze or speech as ways of input to play Minecraft. This 
                                        block movement detection will be another mode of playing Minecraft, by 
                                        using tangible blocks to build structures in real life that can be 
                                        replicated in Minecraft via this code.

                                        This was a group project made by my team for a class. The objective of this 
                                        project was to create a way for users to get their questions answered without 
                                        having to leave Slack, a communication application commonly used by students 
                                        and professionals.
                                    </p>
                
                                    <p>
                                        To approach this, we created a bot that can detect when someone is asking a question. 
                                        If the question is about the definition of word, the bot takes the context of the 
                                        conversation and returns a Wikipedia article with the definition. If the question is 
                                        about where a location is, when an event occurred, or a description of what something is,
                                        the bot returns a response from the Encyclopedia Brittanica.

                                        My contribution to this project was mainly creating the context extraction, question 
                                        detection algorithm, and ":query" command.
