                    <p></p>

                    Using OpenCV and Mediapipe Hands to detect hand motion, hand gestures, 
                    and block locations, we are able to detect when and where a user is 
                    grabbing and releasing a block. 

                    <p></p>

                    We intend to use this block movement detection as an extension to 
                    Multicraft, which is a project that provides multi-modal methods of 
                    playing Minecraft such as using gaze or speech as ways of input to play 
                    Minecraft. This block movement detection will be another mode of playing 
                    Minecraft, by using tangible blocks to build structures in real life that 
                    can be replicated in Minecraft via this code.

                    <p></p> 

                    This provides additional affordances to those who may have trouble playing 
                    Minecraft in the traditional modes, such as those in the BVI community and 
                    younger individuals. 

                    <p></p> 

                    Next steps involve beginning to center our work with the communities we are 
                    trying to work with through this project, redefine our positionality as 
                    researchers, integrating this code into Multicraft, and refining the heuristics 
                    and algorithm used in this code.

                    This was a group project made by my team for a class. The objective of this 
                    project was to create a way for users to get their questions answered without 
                    having to leave Slack, a communication application commonly used by students 
                    and professionals.

                    <p></p>

                    To approach this, we created a bot that can detect when someone is asking a question. 
                    If the question is about the definition of word, the bot takes the context of the 
                    conversation and returns a Wikipedia article with the definition. If the question is 
                    about where a location is, when an event occurred, or a description of what something is,
                    the bot returns a response from the Encyclopedia Brittanica. 
                    
                    <p></p>

                    My contribution to this project was mainly creating the context extraction, question 
                    detection algorithm, and ":query" command.
